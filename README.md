   - Finding and researching top hospitals with adequate infrastructure with destination and accommodation details for friends and family.
   - The user can request an estimated quote for their treatment directly from our website.
   - Based on the patientâ€™s needs our site would recommend the best hospitals or providers. 
   - The hospital can then directly contact and coordinate with the patient for treatment.
   - At the end the treatment can be finalized with the hospital of their choice.
   - Our website would support multiple languages that would help people from all over the world to access the site in their desired language. 
   - The site would have an inbuilt currency convertor which will in turn, make it easier to use.
   - Post treatment/ surgery support and follow-up would be provided through online portal and video consultancy to the patient.
